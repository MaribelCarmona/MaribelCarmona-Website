        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>Hello, my name is Maribel Carmona and I am currently a sophomore at University of California-Riverside. I am double majoring in anthropology and psychology. I am originally from San Diego, California and have been there my whole life up until I moved to Riverside. Throughout my high school years, I have been involved in various organizations and activities which have prompted me into pursuing both anthropology and psychology. Some of those would include Mock Trial, Model United Nations, Rotary, and others. I have also had the opportunity to intern or volunteer with great organizations, such as the San Diego Humane Society. Growing up and having the opportunity to meet new people and help others through different organizations has helped me understand the value of understanding people and taking into the fact that we're all different people coming from different backgrounds. I came into UCR as an anthropology major because I had already seen and experienced the many different cultures and communities in my city and I wanted to further expand my knowledge to the similarities and differences that we all share as humans. As time passed by, I saw how psychology can be applied to further understand people which is why I recently decided to double major in anthropology and psychology. By studying both I can apply my knowledge of human behavior as well as the knowledge of the many different cultures and communities to understand someone to the fullest.<br>

        <br>At first I wasn‚Äôt sure what I wanted to do with my degree in anthropology. Although there are many jobs in which I can use my knowledge and degree to help people, the jobs didn‚Äôt seem to catch my attention and as my mother always said, ‚ÄúMake sure that whatever career you decide on, make sure that you are content with it.‚Äù So as I looked into different careers outside of anthropology I stumbled upon psychology and the many jobs that are offered for psychology majors, which were more up my alley. I figured that I could use both degrees to understand someone or a group of people as best as I can to help them or help other people who want an inside to what the subject is thinking and how to best approach the problem in order to solve it. <br>

        <br>If you‚Äôre wondering as to what jobs that I can apply my knowledge to would include forensic psychology, school counselor, or as a profiler for the FBI. There are many ways in which anthropology and psychology can be helpful and being able to find the middle ground where both come in handy. My main goal for whichever career I decide to pursue is being able to help people as well as trying to understand them in order to help them. I personally think that getting to know someone as best as you can will lead to the proper and more efficient way to understand and help them with what they may be going through. As the years go by, I plan to intern or volunteer for organizations that allow me to be hands on with the job as much as I am able to.<br>
